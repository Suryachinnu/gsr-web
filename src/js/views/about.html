        <p>Adversity is a remarkable teacher. The inception of GSR Trust took place when the COVID-19 pandemic hit our
          world. The pandemic posed enormous challenges and disrupted human life in ways we never imagined. </p>

  <p>
    Within days of the outbreak, - our founders who have cracked many healthcare challenges and worked extensively for
    social causes - were on the ground working with healthcare professionals, hospitals, and MedTech companies to do
    what ever it takes to lessen the impact of this adversity. Their extensive ground work helped them gather thoughtful
    real-time insights in to a crisis that will define an entire generation ahead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given the scale and fury of change during the pandemic and to mount an effective response, our founders actively
    engaged with other thought leaders, doctors, social groups, educators, professional networks and participated in
    collaborative sessions for ideas and solutions to adjust to unrelenting volatility.
  </p>
  <p>
    The members skill fully captured lessons from their discussions and their own first-hand experience as a covid
    warrior. They gathered insights in areas like healthcare, education, and employability. As a country, we faced some
    success stories and setbacks; our founders decided to take each breakdown as a challenge and use it to create a
    breakthrough. The result is the GSRTrust.

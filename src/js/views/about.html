          Within days of the outbreak, - our founders who have earlier cracked many healthcare 
          challenges and worked extensively for social causes - were on the ground working with 
          healthcare professionals, hospitals, and MedTech companies to do what ever it takes to 
          lessen the impact of this adversity. Their extensive ground work helped them gather thoughtful real-
          time insights in to a crisis that will define an entire generation ahead.

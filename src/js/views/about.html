      <span class="about__content-1">
        Within days of the outbreak, - our founders who have cracked many healthcare challenges and worked extensively for
        social causes - were on the ground working with healthcare professionals, hospitals, and MedTech companies to do
        what ever it takes to lessen the impact of this adversity. Their extensive ground work helped them gather thoughtful
        real-time insights in to a crisis that will define an entire generation ahead.
      </span>

      <p class="about__content">
        Given the scale and fury of change during the pandemic and to mount an effective response, our founders actively
        engaged with other thought leaders, doctors, social groups, educators, professional networks and participated in
        collaborative sessions for ideas and solutions to adjust to unrelenting volatility.

      <p class="about__content">
        The members skill fully captured lessons from their discussions and their own first-hand experience as a covid
        warrior. They gathered insights in areas like healthcare, education, and employability. As a country, we faced some
        success stories and setbacks; our founders decided to take each breakdown as a challenge and use it to create a
        breakthrough.<span class="sai">The result is the GSRTrust.</span>

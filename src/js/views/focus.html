            Dear All,
            <br> 
            This year is a mixed bag of emotions.
            We celebrate the Amrut Mahotsav of India's independence while battling a deadly Pandemic, everyday.
            Our freedom, glorious 75 years of independence, is a hard-won gift given to us by our predecessors. 
            Now we have the opportunity to create shared prosperity at an unprecedented level, especially after the pandemic.
            <br>
            <br>
            No need to mention the way the pandemic has affected and changed our lives. We have been through it together. 
            Each of us have been affected, witnessed its effect, fought, braved the situation and emerged stronger from it. 
            Now, we want to focus on the opportunity the pandemic has provided us to do something unique, to reach out others, bring a difference, and create an impact. 
            Seizing of this opportunity depends on you, me, and us. We have a chance that may perhaps not come again for another millennium: to build a society that reflects our deepest values. 
            In a world seemingly going in a multi directions at once, we can, and must, choose a movement with focus, and intention. 
            We need to choose our future and we shall.
            <!-- At no other time has it been so clear: our future is our choice. -->
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite the unprecedented growth that our country has witnessed, the advances in Medicine and Technology, 
            there are still many of people in our country who do not have access to quality healthcare, a good education, and have Employment that will dramatically affect their lives and future. 
            However, these problems can be surmounted by fervently believing in the cause, by joining our hands, coming together and commit ourselves to the cause.
             <!-- if you and I join hands, if we come together and if we commit ourselves to this cause. -->
            <br>
            <br>
            Formation of GSR Trust is our first step towards bringing in the change we wish to see. It is our tribute to our country and a way of pay back to the society. 
            So join us, as we embark on this committed journey to bring about that change. With your support and solidarity, 
            we will rise stronger through this adversity.
            <br>
            <br>
            Jai Hind.

          At GSR, our primary objective is to place people at the center of development. 
          We believe in human dignity, social justice, and solidarity; and are committed to ensuring equitable healthcare facilities, 
          the right to education, and income distribution. We want to empower people with education and employable skills;
           we want to facilitate access to medical healthcare facilities and protect 
           the rights of children and youth. Our efforts are to ensure the inclusion of disadvantaged 
           and vulnerable persons and groups in social development. Our three focus areas of Healthcare, Education, 
           and Employment are stepping stones towards this cause.

            Dear All,
            <br><br>
            This year is a mixed bag of emotions.
            We celebrate the Amrut Mahotsav of India's independence while battling a deadly disease everyday.
            Our freedom, glorious 75 years of independence, is a hard-won gift given to us by our predecessors. 
            Now we have the opportunity to create shared prosperity at an unprecedented level, especially after the pandemic. 
            We don't want to mention the way the pandemic has affected and changed our lives. We have been through it together. 
            Each of us has been affected, each of us has witnessed, fought, and braved the situation and emerged stronger from it. 
            Instead, we want to focus on the opportunity the pandemic has granted us to do something unique, reach out to others, bring a difference, and create an impact. 
            Seizing this opportunity depends on us, you, me, and we. We have a chance that may perhaps not come again for another millennium: to craft a society that reflects our deepest values. 
            In a world seemingly going in a million directions at once, we can, and must, choose a movement, a focus, and an intention. 
            At no other time has it been so clear: our future is our choice. Despite the unprecedented growth that our country has witnessed and our advances in medicine and technology, 
            there are still thousands of people in our country who do not have access to quality healthcare, a good education, or the opportunity to participate in the institutions that will dramatically affect their lives and futures. 
            However, these problem scan be surmounted if we fervently believe in it, if you and I join hands, if we come together and if we commit ourselves to this cause. 
            GSR Trust is our first step towards bringing in the change we wish to see. It is our tribute to our country and away of giving back to society. 
            So join us as we embark on this committed journey to bring about a change. With your support and solidarity, 
            we will rise stronger through this adversity.
            Jai Hind.
